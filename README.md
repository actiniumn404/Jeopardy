### Usage

#### How a game works
The host will first create a deck with the create deck tool (see below) and press "Compile and play." This will open up a new page with a join code on it. The users will go to the join page and insert that code with their username. Once they join, they will be given access to a chat with everyone else, and if they are being too rouge, the host can kick them. As soon as the game starts, the host will be asked to choose who gets to choose and answer the question in the first round. Everyone will be notified of the user who was chosen. After the host starts the round, that user will choose a question, and type their answer. Any time during that, the host can display the answer or move on to the next round. When the choosen user feels confident with his/her answer, they can click "Ok" and then the host will grade their answer. Right or wrong, the program will subtract or add the amont of money the problem is worth from that user's scorecounter. This process repeats and repeasts until there are no more questions to choose from.
